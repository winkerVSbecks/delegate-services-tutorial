<p>We can use <code>$navBarDelegate</code> to call method such as the change of title, picking the direction of animation and showing/hiding the back button.</p>

<p>Alternatively we can get data from the directive, such as the navigation history.</p>

<p><a class="btn btn-block btn-primary btn-outlined" ng-click="goToView(2)">Go To View 2</a></p>

<h4>History Stack</h4>
<p ng-if="history().length==0"><em>no history</em></p>
<ul>
	<li ng-repeat="state in history()">{{state.title}}</li>
</ul>
